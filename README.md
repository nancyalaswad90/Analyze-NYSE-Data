Project Submission
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a presentation file to share your findings. You will also create an Excel workbook that contains your calculations of the summary statistics, dashboard and forecast scenarios.

Evaluation
Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

Submission
What to include in your submission:
A presentation file that should include a slide with:

A statement of the question you posed
Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results
Formatting of your submission:

Feel free to use our template to develop the presentation.
In order to submit your presentation for review, you will need to save your slides as a PDF. You can do this from within Google Slides by selecting File > Download as > PDF Document.
Excel Workbook or Google Sheets with tabs for each of the following:

Dataset
Summary statistics
Profit and Loss statement dashboard
Forecast model for three scenarios
Your workbook can include additional tabs you may need for your project (e.g., pivot tables).
Formatting of your submission:

The Forecast model should be set to the company of your choice. You may choose to have the ticker symbol or name of the company in text at the top for the forecast model.
You will also need to save your spreadsheet in .xlsx format OR provide a link to your Google Sheets. You should provide the link to the Google sheet in your presentation slides since Google Sheets formulas do not download properly into Excel and the reviewer will not be able to see all the formulas.
A list of websites, books, forums, blog posts, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources).
Zip (compress) the folder and submit this zipped folder with both files in it.
